1. First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command in your terminal: "git clone https://github.com/MohamedIjlal27/Front-end-Assignment.git"
2. Change into the directory of the cloned project: "cd <project-directory>" Replace <project-directory> with the name of the directory created after cloning the repository.
3. Before running the project, ensure that all dependencies are installed. Run the following command: "npm install" This command will install all the required dependencies listed in the
   package.json file.
4. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server with: "npm run dev".
5. Vite will start the development server and provide a local URL (typically http://localhost:3000) where you can view the React application.
6. Open your browser and go to the URL provided by the Vite development server (usually http://localhost:3000). You should see your React application running.
